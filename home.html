     concepts which maximize all potential in all school lines and utilize them as educational and learning tools for students.</p>
     <p>Education at the school level is a very complex area which is not always about the delivery of subject matter. However,
         in it, gathered all things that will not only be completed to be explored as students, practitioners and researchers, but also as leadership materials, pedagogy, psychology, communication and so forth.However, of all these complexities there is one thing that is inevitable; schools are built on three pillars of collaboration between students, parents and schoolâ€™s management.
         When one of them is lost or does not play a maximum role, certainly will appear imbalance in the process and at the end result.</p>
